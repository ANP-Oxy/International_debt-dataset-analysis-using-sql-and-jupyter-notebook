 # International debt dataset analysis using SQL
 
- In this project I analyzed the international debt dataset inside jupyter notebook using SQL. 
- I created a postgresql database locally and imported the data from a CSV file into the database table. 
- used ipython-sql to connect to the database and did the analysis using sql magic commands inside jupyter notebook.
