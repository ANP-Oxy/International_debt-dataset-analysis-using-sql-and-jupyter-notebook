 # International debt dataset analysis using SQL
 
 In this project I analyzed the international debt dataset inside jupyter notebook using SQL. 
 I created a postgresql database locally and imported the data from a CSV file into the database table. 
 used ipython-sql to connect to the database and did the analysis using sql magic commands inside jupyter notebook.
